# Expense Management System

The Expense Management System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of recording, tracking, and managing expenses within an organization. It provides individuals with the ability to submit expense requests for payments they have incurred or plan to incur. These requests are then routed through an approval workflow, where designated authorities can review and either approve or reject them. Once approved, the system facilitates the payment of expenses to the requester.

## Features

- **Expense Submission:** Users can submit expense requests along with relevant details such as the amount, purpose, and supporting documentation.

- **Approval Workflow:** Submitted requests are routed through an approval workflow, where designated approvers can review and take action on them.

- **Payment Processing:** Approved expenses are processed for payment, ensuring timely reimbursement to the requester.

- **Notification System:** The system includes a notification system to keep users informed about the status of their expense requests. Notifications are sent via email or through the platform's user interface.
